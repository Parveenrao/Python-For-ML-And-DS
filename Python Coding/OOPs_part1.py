# in started we use procedural programming language

""" later we learn use cocept of function , function taught us reusability means we can use  a block of code again
  and again."""

# function redundancy

""" A better way of function is object oriented programming , to increase reusability """

# object---> to map with real world scernario we use object in programming
# before object we make class of object
# just like string , list are object


# Class ----> classs ia blueprint of a object
# class name is written in capital letter
