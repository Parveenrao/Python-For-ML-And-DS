# what is exception ---> lets uunderstang through an example

"""num1 = 10
num2 = 0

result = num1 / num2
print(result)   # it gives zero division error  throwing an excetion"""

# Program 2

num3 = 10
num4 = "hello"

result1 = num3 + num4
print(result1)    # it will give type error

# an exception is an event which occur during execution of program and disrupt the normal flow of program

# typically  these are the situation that python intrepreter cant handle with it

# difference between error and exceptio

# error cannot be handled  they need to be removed

# except can be handled by the programmer using exception handle syntax
